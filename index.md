## Philosophy

This knowledge base is **not** a collection of AI hype or surface-level summaries. It is:

- **Signal over noise**: Curated insights from experience, research, and critical evaluation
- **Depth over breadth**: Each topic explored with technical rigor and practical context
- **Referenced and sourced**: Every claim traced to papers, projects, or real implementations
- **Opinion-driven**: Personal insights and reasoned perspectives, not just facts
- **Anti-fluff**: No AI-generated filler; every word earns its place

**Target audience**: AI/DS technical leaders, senior practitioners, and those building real-world AI systems.

## The Five Domains

This knowledge base is organized around five overlapping domains of AI leadership:

### ðŸ”§ [Systems & Infrastructure](01-systems-infrastructure/)
{: .d-inline-block }
Engineering Spine
{: .label .label-blue }

How modern AI systems are built, deployed, and scaledâ€”from data pipelines to production inference.

**Core topics**: MLOps, cloud architecture, orchestration, vector databases, deployment stacks, cost optimization

---

### ðŸ§  [Modeling & Intelligence](02-modeling-intelligence/)
{: .d-inline-block }
Cognitive Layer
{: .label .label-purple }

How models reason, generalize, and failâ€”both traditional ML and modern LLMs.

**Core topics**: Embeddings, fine-tuning, retrieval, alignment, interpretability, evaluation, uncertainty

---

### ðŸ“Š [AI Product & Strategy](03-product-strategy/)
{: .d-inline-block }
Translation Layer
{: .label .label-green }

Connecting AI capabilities to real business leverage.

**Core topics**: Use case identification, success metrics, ROI frameworks, productization lifecycle

---

### ðŸ‘¥ [People & Organization](04-people-organization/)
{: .d-inline-block }
Scaling Layer
{: .label .label-yellow }

How teams, incentives, and governance shape AI success.

**Core topics**: Cross-functional leadership, technical storytelling, ethics, experimentation culture, team design

---

### ðŸŽ¯ [Meta-Learning](05-meta-learning/)
{: .d-inline-block }
Self-Evolution Layer
{: .label .label-red }

Systems for continuous learning, prioritization, and evaluation of new ideas.

**Core topics**: Knowledge systems, signal filters, learning frameworks, feedback loops

---

## Quick Start

### New to this knowledge base?

1. Read the [Philosophy](00-framework/meta-philosophy.md) to understand what makes this different
2. Review the [Framework Overview](00-framework/overview.md) for the five-domain architecture
3. Check the [Quick Start Guide](00-framework/quickstart.md) for navigation tips

### Looking for specific knowledge?

Navigate to a domain above and explore:
- **Foundational** concepts (enduring truths)
- **Intermediate** techniques (slower-changing practices)
- **Advanced** topics (faster-changing innovations)
