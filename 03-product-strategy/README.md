## Learning Path

**If you're starting out** → Focus on use case frameworks and success metrics

**If you're launching AI features** → Master ROI modeling and stakeholder communication

**If you're building AI-native products** → Dive into differentiation and scaling strategies

## Key Frameworks

### Use Case Evaluation Matrix

| Criteria | Weight | Questions |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| **Value** | High | Does this solve a real, expensive problem? |
| **Feasibility** | High | Can AI actually do this reliably? |
| **Data** | Medium | Do we have/can we get the needed data? |
| **Competitive** | Medium | Does this create defensible advantage? |
| **Risk** | High | What's the downside of failure? |

### AI Success Metrics Hierarchy

1. **Business metrics** (the goal): Revenue, cost savings, user growth
2. **Product metrics** (leading indicators): Engagement, task completion, user satisfaction
3. **AI metrics** (diagnostics): Accuracy, latency, coverage

*Always connect AI metrics → product metrics → business metrics*

### Build vs. Buy Decision Framework

**Build when**:
- Core competitive differentiator
- Unique data or domain requirements
- Need for deep customization
- Long-term strategic capability

**Buy/API when**:
- Commodity capability (e.g., general LLM)
- Rapid iteration needed
- Non-core functionality
- Specialized expertise required

## Current State (October 2025)

**Major trends**:
- Shift from "AI feature" to "AI-native" product thinking
- LLM APIs commoditizing general capabilities
- Differentiation through domain data and specialized models
- User expectations for AI rapidly increasing
- Regulatory scrutiny intensifying (EU AI Act, etc.)

**Key challenges**:
- Building moats in the foundation model era
- Managing user expectations around AI reliability
- Pricing AI products as costs fluctuate
- Balancing innovation speed with responsible deployment

## Common Anti-Patterns

**✗ Solution looking for problem**: Building AI because it's cool, not because it solves a real need

**✗ Confusing demo with product**: What works in a demo often fails at scale or with real users

**✗ Ignoring the feedback loop**: AI products need continuous learning from user behavior

**✗ Underestimating infrastructure costs**: Inference costs can destroy unit economics

**✗ Overpromising capabilities**: Leading to user disappointment and churn
