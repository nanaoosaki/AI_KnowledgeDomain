## Learning Path

**If you're starting out** → Build knowledge management system and identify high-signal sources

**If you're actively learning** → Master paper reading and build-to-learn techniques

**If you're established** → Focus on synthesis, teaching, and original contribution

## The Three Mental Filters

### 1. Relevance Filter
*Does this knowledge help me understand, build, or lead something that relates to my mission?*

**Questions to ask**:
- Is this connected to my current projects or near-term goals?
- Does this fill a gap in my understanding?
- Will this help me make better decisions?

**Example**:
- ✓ RAG optimization (building search product)
- ✗ Latest gaming AI (not your domain)

### 2. Temporal Filter
*Is this a fast-changing or slow-changing truth?*

**Fast-changing** (learn just-in-time):
- Specific model architectures
- Framework APIs
- Benchmark rankings
- Tool ecosystems

**Slow-changing** (invest deeply):
- Evaluation principles
- Probabilistic reasoning
- System design patterns
- Causality and experimentation
- Communication and leadership

**Priority**: Invest more in slow-changing fundamentals

### 3. Depth Filter
*Do I need working fluency or strategic literacy?*

**Working fluency** (can implement):
- Your team's core tech stack
- Your primary domain expertise
- Tools you use daily

**Strategic literacy** (understand trade-offs):
- Adjacent technologies
- Emerging techniques
- Alternative approaches

**Reality**: You can't be expert at everything. Choose depth strategically.

## Knowledge Management Systems

### Personal Knowledge Base (This Repo!)
**Purpose**: Deep, structured knowledge with connections

**Principles**:
- Write in your own words (no copy-paste)
- Connect concepts explicitly
- Include personal insights and lessons
- Tag by domain, level, temporal stability
- Reference primary sources

### Quick Capture System
**Purpose**: Inbox for ideas, links, fleeting notes

**Options**:
- Notion quick capture
- Obsidian daily notes
- Simple markdown files
- Voice memos → transcripts

**Rule**: Process weekly into knowledge base

### Project-Based Learning Log
**Purpose**: Learning from doing

**Template for each project**:
- What I tried
- What worked / didn't work
- Why (hypotheses)
- What I learned
- What I'd do differently

## Learning Strategies

### For Research Papers

1. **Three-pass approach**:
   - Pass 1: Title, abstract, conclusions (5 min) → Keep or discard?
   - Pass 2: Skim sections, look at figures (15 min) → Understand contribution
   - Pass 3: Deep read, verify claims (1+ hr) → Could I implement this?

2. **Active reading**:
   - Summarize in your own words
   - Identify assumptions and limitations
   - Connect to what you already know
   - Ask: "So what? Why does this matter?"

### For New Tools/Frameworks

1. **Don't just read docs** → Build something small
2. **Understand the why** → What problem does this solve?
3. **Compare** → How does this differ from alternatives?
4. **Document gotchas** → What tripped you up?

### For Conceptual Understanding

1. **Feynman Technique**:
   - Explain concept in simple terms
   - Identify gaps in your explanation
   - Go back to source material
   - Simplify and use analogies

2. **Build mental models** → How does this fit into the bigger picture?

## Teaching as Learning Amplifier

**Why teaching works**:
- Forces clear thinking
- Reveals gaps in understanding
- Creates retrieval practice
- Builds reputation and network

**Formats**:
- Internal tech talks
- Blog posts / knowledge base entries
- Mentoring junior engineers
- Conference talks / workshops
- Open source documentation

**Rule**: If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it deeply enough.

## Building Feedback Loops

### Weekly Review
- What did I learn this week?
- What worked / didn't work in my learning approach?
- What's the highest-priority knowledge gap right now?

### Monthly Synthesis
- Thematic deep-dive on one topic
- Connect concepts across domains
- Write synthesis piece for knowledge base

### Quarterly Reflection
- How has the field shifted?
- What mental models need updating?
- Am I learning the right things?

### Project Retrospectives
- After every significant project
- What did I learn that I didn't expect?
- What would I do differently?

## Current State (October 2025)

**Challenges**:
- Information overload intensifying
- Quality signal harder to find amid AI-generated content
- Pace of change accelerating
- Balancing depth vs. breadth increasingly difficult

**Opportunities**:
- Better tools for knowledge management
- More open research and code
- Thriving communities for learning
- AI tools to augment learning (used wisely)

## Anti-Patterns

**✗ Passive consumption**: Reading without synthesizing or applying

**✗ Tutorial hell**: Following tutorials endlessly without building original projects

**✗ Completionism**: Trying to read/learn everything in a domain

**✗ Hype chasing**: Learning every new tool without understanding fundamentals

**✗ Hoarding without processing**: Saving links/articles you never revisit

**✗ Learning without sharing**: Keeping all knowledge locked in your head

**Remember**: The goal isn't to know everything. It's to build a system that helps you learn the right things, at the right depth, at the right time.
