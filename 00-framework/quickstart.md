# Quick Start Guide

> Get oriented in the AI Knowledge Domain

## What Is This?

A living knowledge base for AI/DS technical leadership—structured around five core domains, built for depth over breadth, and designed to cut through AI hype with referenced insights and practical experience.

## Where to Start

### If you're new here...

**Start with the philosophy**:
1. Read [README.md](../README.md) for the overall vision
2. Understand [The Philosophy](./meta-philosophy.md) behind this knowledge base
3. Review [Framework Overview](./overview.md) for the five-domain architecture

### If you know what you're looking for...

Navigate directly to a domain:
- [Systems & Infrastructure](../01-systems-infrastructure/) - Building and deploying AI systems
- [Modeling & Intelligence](../02-modeling-intelligence/) - How models work and fail
- [Product & Strategy](../03-product-strategy/) - Connecting AI to business value
- [People & Organization](../04-people-organization/) - Leading AI teams
- [Meta-Learning](../05-meta-learning/) - Systems for continuous learning

### If you want to contribute...

Read [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md) for:
- Content templates
- Quality standards
- Writing guidelines

## Structure

Each domain follows this pattern:

```
domain-folder/
├── README.md              # Overview, capabilities, learning path
├── foundational/          # Core concepts (enduring truths)
├── intermediate/          # Applied techniques (slower-changing)
└── advanced/              # Specialized topics (faster-changing)
```

## Content Principles

Every entry includes:
- ✓ **Context**: Why this concept matters
- ✓ **Technical depth**: How it actually works
- ✓ **Trade-offs**: When it works, when it fails
- ✓ **References**: Papers, implementations, sources
- ✓ **Personal insights**: Opinions and experience

Every entry avoids:
- ✗ AI-generated fluff
- ✗ Marketing speak
- ✗ Unsupported claims
- ✗ Surface-level summaries

## How to Use This

### For Learning
1. Pick a domain based on your gaps
2. Start with foundational concepts
3. Build projects to apply knowledge
4. Document your learnings back here

### For Reference
- Use search (Ctrl+F or GitHub search) to find concepts
- Follow cross-links between related topics
- Check references for deeper exploration

### For Decision-Making
- Look up trade-offs for technical choices
- Review failure modes and gotchas
- Compare alternative approaches

```

All five domains interconnect. Strong leadership requires capabilities across all.

## Current State (October 2025)

**Status**: 🌱 Foundation established, content growing

**What's here**:
- ✓ Complete framework and philosophy
- ✓ Domain structures and READMEs
- ✓ Learning paths and resources
- ✓ Contribution guidelines

**What's next** (add as you learn):
- Foundational concept entries
- Intermediate technique deep-dives
- Advanced topic explorations
- Cross-domain synthesis pieces

## Three Key Questions

Use these to guide what to learn next:

1. **Relevance**: Does this help me understand, build, or lead something in my mission?
2. **Temporal**: Is this fast-changing (learn just-in-time) or slow-changing (invest deeply)?
3. **Depth**: Do I need working fluency or strategic literacy?

See [Meta-Learning](../05-meta-learning/) for the full filter framework.

## How This Evolves

This knowledge base grows through:

- **Addition**: New concepts from learning and experience
- **Refinement**: Better explanations as understanding deepens
- **Connection**: New links as patterns emerge across domains
- **Pruning**: Removing outdated or low-value content
- **Reorganization**: Improved structure as the graph matures

## Contributing

This is a personal knowledge base made public. External contributions are welcome if they:
- Match the quality standards
- Add genuine depth
- Include proper references
- Offer personal insights

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md) for details.
