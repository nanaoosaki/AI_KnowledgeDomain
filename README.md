# AI Knowledge Domain

> A living knowledge base for AI/DS technical leadership â€” built on depth, discernment, and deliberate learning.

## Philosophy

This knowledge base is **not** a collection of AI hype or surface-level summaries. It is:

- **Signal over noise**: Curated insights from experience, research, and critical evaluation
- **Depth over breadth**: Each topic explored with technical rigor and practical context
- **Referenced and sourced**: Every claim traced to papers, projects, or real implementations
- **Opinion-driven**: Personal insights and reasoned perspectives, not just facts
- **Anti-fluff**: No AI-generated filler; every word earns its place

**Target audience**: AI/DS technical leaders, senior practitioners, and those building real-world AI systems.

## Architecture

This knowledge base is organized around five overlapping domains of AI leadership:

### 1. [Systems & Infrastructure](./01-systems-infrastructure/)
*The engineering spine*

How modern AI systems are built, deployed, and scaledâ€”from data pipelines to production inference.

**Core topics**: MLOps, cloud architecture, orchestration, vector databases, deployment stacks, cost optimization

### 2. [Modeling & Intelligence](./02-modeling-intelligence/)
*The cognitive layer*

How models reason, generalize, and failâ€”both traditional ML and modern LLMs.

**Core topics**: Embeddings, fine-tuning, retrieval, alignment, interpretability, evaluation, uncertainty

### 3. [AI Product & Strategy](./03-product-strategy/)
*The translation layer*

Connecting AI capabilities to real business leverage.

**Core topics**: Use case identification, success metrics, ROI frameworks, productization lifecycle

### 4. [People & Organization](./04-people-organization/)
*The scaling layer*

How teams, incentives, and governance shape AI success.

**Core topics**: Cross-functional leadership, technical storytelling, ethics, experimentation culture, team design

### 5. [Meta-Learning](./05-meta-learning/)
*The self-evolution layer*

Systems for continuous learning, prioritization, and evaluation of new ideas.

**Core topics**: Knowledge systems, signal filters, learning frameworks, feedback loops

## Content Standards

Each knowledge entry follows these principles:

**Structure**:
- Clear problem statement or concept definition
- Technical depth with working examples where applicable
- References to papers, implementations, or primary sources
- Personal insights and trade-offs learned from experience
- Connections to related concepts across domains

**Quality markers**:
- âœ“ Cites specific papers, repos, or implementations
- âœ“ Includes trade-offs and failure modes
- âœ“ Offers actionable insights for practitioners
- âœ“ Links to related concepts in knowledge graph
- âœ— No marketing speak or vendor advocacy
- âœ— No unsupported claims or speculation
- âœ— No AI-generated filler content

## Using This Knowledge Base

**For exploration**: Start with the [Framework Overview](./00-framework/overview.md) to understand the mental models

**For specific topics**: Navigate to domain folders and browse by concept

**For learning paths**: Check curated learning sequences in each domain's README

**For contributing**: See [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for templates and guidelines
