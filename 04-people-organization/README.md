*The Scaling Layer*
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

> How teams, culture, and governance enable or constrain AI success

## Domain Overview

AI systems are socio-technical systems. Technical excellence doesn't scale through individuals alone. This domain covers building teams, culture, and organizational structures that multiply AI impact.

## Core Capabilities

- **Team Building**: Hiring, structuring, and developing AI teams
- **Cross-functional Leadership**: Bridging technical and business stakeholders
- **Technical Communication**: Storytelling, influence, and teaching
- **Culture Design**: Building experimentation and learning mindsets
- **Governance & Ethics**: Responsible AI practices and oversight
- **Knowledge Sharing**: Documentation, mentorship, internal platforms
- **Process Design**: Workflows that enable rather than constrain

## Learning Path

**If you're starting out** → Focus on communication and collaboration fundamentals

**If you're leading a team** → Master hiring, feedback, and culture building

**If you're leading an organization** → Dive into governance, change management, and platform thinking

## Key Frameworks

### AI Team Structure Patterns

**Embedded Model**: AI/ML engineers embedded in product teams
- ✓ Close to business context
- ✗ Risk of siloed knowledge

**Centralized Model**: Central AI/ML team serving all products
- ✓ Shared expertise and infrastructure
- ✗ Can become bottleneck

**Hybrid Model**: Central platform team + embedded specialists
- ✓ Combines strengths
- ✗ Requires more coordination

*Choose based on company size, AI maturity, and product portfolio*

### Responsible AI Framework

1. **Fairness**: Bias testing and mitigation
2. **Privacy**: Data protection and user consent
3. **Transparency**: Explainability and disclosure
4. **Accountability**: Clear ownership and governance
5. **Safety**: Risk assessment and failure modes
6. **Human oversight**: Humans in the loop where needed

### Technical Storytelling Structure

1. **Context**: Why this matters to the audience
2. **Challenge**: The problem we're solving
3. **Approach**: How AI helps (accessible explanation)
4. **Trade-offs**: What we're optimizing for
5. **Impact**: Business outcomes and next steps

## Current State (October 2025)

**Major trends**:
- Every company becoming an "AI company" → talent wars intensifying
- Shift from pure ML engineers to "AI-enabled" product engineers
- Increased regulatory scrutiny → governance becoming critical
- Democratization of AI → internal education at scale
- Remote work → new collaboration patterns for AI teams

**Key challenges**:
- Retaining top talent in competitive market
- Balancing innovation speed with responsible deployment
- Bridging gap between research and production mindsets
- Managing expectations around AI capabilities
- Building diverse and inclusive AI teams

## Common Anti-Patterns

**✗ Hero culture**: Depending on individual genius rather than team capabilities

**✗ Research-production divide**: Researchers and engineers not collaborating effectively

**✗ Governance theater**: Ethics/safety processes that don't actually prevent harm

**✗ Over-process**: Bureaucracy that kills experimentation and innovation

**✗ Under-communication**: Technical teams not explaining trade-offs to stakeholders

**✗ Neglecting documentation**: Knowledge locked in individual heads

## Essential Skills for AI Leaders

### Technical Credibility
- Deep enough to evaluate technical decisions
- Current enough to understand new developments
- Practical enough to spot implementation risks

### Communication
- Translate technical complexity for non-technical stakeholders
- Write clear technical documentation
- Present compellingly to executives

### People Skills
- Build psychological safety for experimentation
- Give constructive feedback
- Develop talent and build careers
- Navigate organizational politics

### Strategic Thinking
- Connect technical work to business outcomes
- Prioritize ruthlessly
- Balance short-term delivery with long-term capability building
